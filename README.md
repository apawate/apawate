### Hello!
###
### I'm a 9th grader with avid interests in many aspects of coding.
###

Here's some things I'm working on:
  - Coding the game of Set in Python (for my Computer Programming class)
    - The repo is private for now (I don't want other classmates stealing the code) but I'll make it public once I finish. *Update: I submitted it yesterday (3/26), so it will be available soon.)
    - Currently, I'm trying to make it multiplayer in real-time over the internet, which is hard. There's one bug which keeps popping up...
  - Working on software for my robotics team, @Team846
