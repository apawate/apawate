#### Here's some things I'm doing:
  - Working on [**Mappy**](https://github.com/apawate/mappy), which is an Arduino mapping and route-saving robot
  - Working on software for my robotics team, [@Team846](https://github.com/Team846) 
  - Slowly improving my [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman) game

#### Active repos:
  - [**Mappy**](https://github.com/apawate/mappy): A map and route Arduino robot. 
  - [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman): Something interesting I made in just over an hour. A simple game of hangman using ASCII characters and Python.
