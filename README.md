#### Here's some things I'm doing:
  - Working on software for my robotics team, [@Team846](https://github.com/Team846) 
  - Slowly improving my [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman) game
  - Developing my [**Website**](https://apawate.github.io)

#### Active repos:
  - [**Piano Video**](https://github.com/apawate/piano_video): Working on the Piano Video project with Patrick Huang, who is the owner and operator of the repository and created all of it. (I've literally made two changes).
  - [**Set Game**](https://github.com/apawate/Python3-Set-Game-2021): Basic functionality is good for the most part, and it can (almost) be played in realtime over the internet. **THE GAME IS NOW PUBLIC!** 
  - [**ASCII Hangman**](https://github.com/apawate/ascii-hangman): Something interesting I made in just over an hour. A simple game of hangman using ASCII characters and Python.
